// Guard: fail the build if a one-shot package runner reappears anywhere in this
// repository's sources, harnesses, docs or CI.
//
// The runners in question are the npm, bun, pnpm and yarn "fetch it and run it"
// commands. Given a name that does not resolve locally they download whatever the
// public registry serves under that name and execute it. Several of the names our
// harnesses used to pass are bin commands rather than package names, so the name
// we meant and the name we would get were never guaranteed to be the same thing.
//
// WHY A GUARD SCRIPT AND NOT A MACHINE-LEVEL DENY RULE. A shell deny rule can only
// inspect a command line. Every occurrence this ticket removed was a spawn() from
// inside a Node script, so the command a developer actually approved was
// "pnpm run e2e" and the runner was never visible to any matcher. Only something
// that reads the files can see these.
//
// The patterns below are assembled from character fragments on purpose, so that
// this file does not contain the very tokens it searches for and therefore does
// not need to exempt itself. Exempting the directory a guard lives in is how a
// future real occurrence gets silently waved through.
//
// Run: node scripts/check-no-bare-launchers.mjs   (wired into "pnpm test")
