// hardcoded across robotTools.ts and App.vue: move_forward, move_backward,
// turn_left, turn_right, stop, read_distance, read_status, finish_task.
//
// Leaf module: only 'zod' + ../robotToolNames.js (also a leaf). Safe to

// IMPORTANT: gaunt-sloth's AG-UI server treats a client-declared run-input
// tool as *authoritative* for client-fulfilled tools — it drops the
// server's own config.tools entry by name and binds the client's
// name/description/parameters straight through to the model
// (buildClientToolStub in @gaunt-sloth/agent's apiAgUiModule.ts). So for
// move_forward/move_backward/turn_left/turn_right, the `jsonSchema` below
// (not `zodSchema`) is what the model actually sees. Pre-RC-1, the
// server's zod description and the client's hand-written JSON Schema
// description for `steps` had already drifted apart (different wording).
// Preserving that exact (pre-existing) split verbatim here — rather than
// consolidating onto one string — is what makes this a true byte-for-byte
// reproduction of prior model-facing behaviour, not just prior server-side
// code.

// capture a Before frame, drive this tool's own motion endpoint, halt with
// /stop, capture an After frame, compose them, and return the single image.
// The motion http step resolves its path from the def's `clientEndpoint`, so
// one recipe serves /forward, /backward, /turn_left and /turn_right.
//
// The `/stop` step: whether a *bounded* `steps` motion still needs an explicit
// halt is a QD021-firmware GAIT fact — its walk/turn gaits free-run until told
// to stop, so a bounded move must be terminated or the robot keeps going while
// the After frame is captured. That is exactly why the halt belongs here as
// recipe DATA and not as a hardcoded call: a robot whose gait self-terminates
// after `steps` cycles would simply drop this one line and behave correctly.
